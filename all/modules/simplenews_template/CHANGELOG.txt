---------------------------------------
#329247 by spade: Removed <!-- and --> in the default template.
#345246 by guitarmiami: Fixed a bug in _simplenews_template_starts_with() that
  made phptemplate_mimemail_message() to call theme_mimemail_message().
Because mimemail_html_to_text() only matchs <style>...</style> when the opening
  and closing tags are on the same line, \n and \r in the style must be
  removed.

  precaution, insert LF after each closing bracket.
#329249 by spade: Added support for Simplenews' variable substitution tokens,
