JS Injector
============
Allows administrators to inject JS (JavaScript Files) into the page output based on configurable rules. The JS is added using Drupal's standard drupal_add_js() function and respects page caching, scope and preprocess.

It provides site administrators with a quick and easy way of tweaking things.

JS Injector is based on a hack of CSS Injector
