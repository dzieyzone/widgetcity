Load page's images only if they were visible or requested by user

Requirements: Drupal 6.x

--- Known issues -------------------------------------------------------------

Some notes by jquery plugin author (http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload)

Due to webkit bug #6656 Lazy Loading wont give you any improvements in Safari. It will load all images you wanted it or not.

It seems jQuery 1.3.x breaks the plugin for IE. All images get loaded in the background even when they should not. I am working on it. In the meanwhile stay with jQuery 1.2.6.

Also you are using Mint you should have mint tag in the header of the page. Mint tag in the end of the page interferes with Lazy Load plugin. This is rather peculiar problem. If somebody finds an answer let me know.

--- INSTALLATION --------------------------------------------------------

Like other Drupal modules extract the archive into sites/all/modules and visit "admin/settings/lazy_image_loader" 
to adjust its parameters.
