After enable of elysia_cron module from drupal module administration you should 
change the server crontab to launch drupal cron process each minute.


IT'S NOT MANDATORY: you can leave default drupal cron rule - a run on 45 minutes 
after every hour - but that way if you have job rules with an exact time for
execution, that rules won't work as expected. And you won't be able to  execute 
a process more than once an hour.
So, if you want to use the full power of elysia cron, it's suggested that you
change your crontab. 


To do this refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation
(http://drupal.org/cron), the only difference is that the schedule rule must 
be "* * * * *".
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php


TO ENABLE CRON KEY SECURITY:
If you want to enable cron-key security you should also add the choosen
cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the call.
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/cron.php?cron_key=XYZ


PERMISSIONS:
You can also give 'administer elysia_cron' permission to all user roles that 
needs to administer cron jobs. 


Nothing more.
By default elysia_cron will run all standard cron jobs sequentially (in a single
channel) at 45 minutes after every hour.
You can change this behavious with elysia_cron setup.

To access elysia_cron setup, and change the scheduling of your jobs or view
execution stats, go to page admin/build/cron


Note: to better see warnings on administration page you should consider adding 
a rule for "warn" class to theme CSS stylesheet, like this one:
.warn { color: red; font-weight: bold; }


ADVANCED
---------

With the standard installation described above elysia cron will be launched
by standard drupal cron.
This add a little overhead to all cron calls (expecially for cache management
of variables, that is purged at each cron call).
You can usually ignore that, however if you want you can completely skip drupal
cron (and launch elysia_cron directly) by replacing file "cron.php" in the
root of drupal dir with the one in the elysia_cron package.
If you do so you must remember to not replace cron.php when upgrading drupal
core. 

To avoid the replacement of cron.php you can also call directly elysia cron's 
cron.php in crontab. 
Example:
* * * * * /usr/bin/wget -O - -q http://example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php

Note: This example works if you installed elysia_cron in "sites/all/modules" 
dir. If you installed elsewhere use that path instead.
